# GuitarUI
# This is the UI for the Guitar Project. It includes a song selection scene that will take you to a separate scene based on which song you pick.
# Then, by pressing Start, the song will play and rectangle "beats" will scroll across the screen to the rhythm of the song
# Quick note that each song scene is an instance of a generalized class, AnimateScene

# End of year 2018
The stepper motor is not fast enough to move the carriage up and down, this is working on being replaced with a special motor. The pistons hit each string pretty hard causing the guitar to pick up some of the sounds when playing a chord.

The mute bar is working on being replaced to mute individual strings when not in use. Currently the mute bar does not work as intended as the guitar picks up sound from the mute bar.

Songs need to be sped up to sound closer to real life.
